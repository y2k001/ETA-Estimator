then >ng serve
# ETA-Estimator
Delivery ETA Estimator
The application has been developed using following data as reference and assumptions and works just to show delivery of orders.Data to be entered is case sensitive currently.<br>
Products and region delay data are mocked in DataStore.cs
Submitted orders are stored in an in-memory ConcurrentDictionary<br>
Delivery is estimated based on region and stock available
Estimated delivery days based on:

Region delay (e.g., West = 7 days)

Product availability (in-stock vs out-of-stock delay)

The application comprises of two solutions front end ui in Angular and backend api built using Web API C#.

Add data to the fields in UI as per data stored in backend.<br>
The backend has data stored as:<br>
For products ‚Äì <br>
ProductId = "P1001", Name = "Washing Machine", InStock = true <br>
ProductId = "P1002", Name = "Fridge", InStock = false <br>
ProductId = "P1003", Name = "Dishwasher", InStock = true <br>
ProductId = "P1004", Name = "Oven", InStock = false <br>
For products to be delivered in days as per region mentioned, data is as:<br>
North-> 2, here for North region, number of days to deliver is 2 <br>
 South-> 5,<br>
East -> 3,<br>
West-> 7<br>


On adding data in the text fields and submitting, we get as follows<br>
